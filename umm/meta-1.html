        Many things happen in this current age, people dying, governments lying, games growing old, and on top of all that, time is patiently moving forward. That makes me often wonder, whether i've found my place yet, am i doing my <i>thing</i> yet, or not.

        While that is uncertain, and definitely changes from time to time, one thing i can say for sure, i really liked that one website, and have decided to make one of my own, purely because it looks neat-o

        When i first saw dukope's site, i was surprised at how simple and elegant it was, font seeming familiar, css styling being both effortless, and passive, staying nicely out of you way, it really enchanted me, despite how insignificant it was.

        The content itself was good in its own right as well, but the Main thing was the technical marvel and elegance of the site, and me having a teensy tiny background in website making, decided to try my hand at making a copycat, seeing how it works out.
