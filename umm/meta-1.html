        Many things happen in this current age, people dying, governments lying, games growing old, and on top of all that, time is patiently moving forward. That makes me often wonder, whether i've found my place yet, am i doing my <i>thing</i> yet, or not.
    </p>
    <p>
        While that is uncertain, and definitely changes from time to time, one thing i can say for sure, i really liked that one website, and have decided to make one of my own, purely because it looks neat-o
    </p>
    <h3>Part 1 - Genesis</h3> <!--instead of a green subpage title, a black one with a green stylized bulletpoint might be better-->
    <p>
        When i first saw <a href="https://dukope.com/devlogs/papers-please/mobile/" style="text-decoration: underline" target="_blank">dukope's site</a>, i was surprised at how simple and elegant it was, font seeming familiar, css styling being both effortless, and passive, staying nicely out of you way, it really enchanted me, despite how insignificant it was.
    </p>
    <p>
        The content itself was good in its own right as well, but the Main thing was the technical marvel and elegance of the site, and me having a teensy tiny background in website making, decided to try my hand at making a copycat, seeing how it works out.
    </p>
    <p>
        And so I sat down, and just wrote it up in around three-four hours over two days. It wasn’t very hard, nor technically demanding, but I can say with certainty that it was fun. It really helped me rediscover the joy I had when I was still making new websites to keep up with school projects, and the joy of applying my knowledge. Though to be fair I did have to google a few times to make sure how youre supposed to use some tags and such.
    </p>
    <p>
        Biggest issue with this project, and many others of mine, is that I struggle to ever finish them, or even bring them to a presentable state, because of my self-imposed perfectionism. Use a framework there, cram a design pattern there, use bootstrap for no reason at all, or try to force floats everywhere because they technically use less memory that double. All that detail chasing and nitpicking stops most of my projects dead in their tracks, so im very glad to see at least this one take shape, such as it is.
    </p>
    <h3>Part 2 - Questions youre probably having</h3>
    <p>
        <i>Q: why havent you done this in x, why didn’t you use a framework/a third party site to do all the legwork for you?</i><br>
        A: im still new to this so I don’t know where to copy “simple blog sites in a very specific style I picked” from. As for frameworks I don’t know any, and I don’t see a reason for learning them, seeing as I don’t make websites at all. However, future likes to be unpredictable, and I’ll remain open to learning a framework or a bootstrap anytime, within reason!<br>
        <br>
        </i>Q: why didn’t you do it better?</i><br>
        A: id rather have it done alright than abandon it because I did it wrong at some point and had to redo it from ground up (looking at you, subpages).<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        To close off, I acknowledge that the website is scuffed, and its probably not very maintainable in the long-run, but honestly I don’t mind, I just had an idea and made it a reality! Maybe one day my tastes will change and ill redesign the thing from the ground up, maybe add night mode, or implement responsive design (no chance).<br><br>
        That’s all for now, you go on and have a nice day.<br>
